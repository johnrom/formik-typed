A proof of concept. Making forms less verbose in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) shouldn't cause you to lose your [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) typings. This package provides a wrapper for [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/) that will strongly type your field and auto-populate its name based on your Formik `FormValues` shape.

Status: **pre-Alpha**

Before use, check out the [Formik Docs](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/overview).
