Making forms less verbose in [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) shouldn't cause you to lose your [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org) typings. This package provides a wrapper for [Formik](https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/) that will strongly type your field name and give you that name when you need it.

Status: **Alpha**

Before use, check out the [Formik Docs](https://jaredpalmer.com/formik/docs/overview).
